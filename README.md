# FootNotes

Footnotes is [Soundcloud-style](https://soundcloud.com/kanyewest/nomorepartiesinla) comments (time-tied comments) for Youtube vidoes.  Unlike Soundcloud, comments are not public, but they can be shared in realtime with friends who also have FootNotes.  It's a chrome extension.  There is a small backend component at [Footnotes-back](https://github.com/ahoskins/FootNotes-back).

Currently, FootNotes is not released, but it will be soon.  But it is functional, and can demoed by cloning this repo and loading the root directory in chrome as an unpacked extension.

FootNotes was made during the 3rd annual UAlberta Hackathon.
